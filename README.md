## Simple Stocks

Simple Stocks is a simplified version of the Apple Stocks app with more relevant information on future stock values. Using the Yahoo Finance API Simple Stocks will present relevant information such as Chart Events indicating bullish or bearish patterns, and performance outlook in the short term (2 weeks - 6 weeks), mid-term (6 weeks - 9 months), and long-term (9+ months). Furthermore, the application will present users with the fair value of a specific stock so users can determine if said stock is overvalued or undervalued.
